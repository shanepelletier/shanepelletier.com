I've come across a few ambiguous acronyms that I've decided to write down as both a quick reference whenever I run into one of them outside of the context I'm used to seeing them, and because I think the ambiguity can be amusing.

| Acronym | Meaning I'm used to       | Other meanings                   |
| ------- | ------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| SAR     | Synthetic Aperture Radar  | Subject Access Request           |
| SQL     | Structured Query Language | Sales Qualified Lead             |
| SDR     | Software Defined Radio    | Sales Development Representative |
| CRA     | Canada Revenue Agency     | Cyber Resilience Act             |
