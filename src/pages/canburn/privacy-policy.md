# Privacy Policy

Canburn makes use of some personal data in order to provide you with the service.

Canburn uses the Mapbox Maps SDK via [rnmapbox/maps](https://github.com/rnmapbox/maps). See the [Mapbox Privacy Policy](https://www.mapbox.com/legal/privacy) for full details of the data collected. In summary, this application sends standard browsing information (IP address, system information, etc.) as well as limited location data. We use location data to provide you with a location marker on the map, but do not store or forward that data to any web server except as outlined in the Mapbox Privacy Policy.

In addition, this application sends basic usage information to a web server running in an AWS EC2 instance which is used to count the number of times certain actions are performed. This information takes the form of key-value pairs (e.g., {"button1": 12}), and is not tied to any specific device and is not sold to any third parties, although it may be disclosed through the Canburn website and by other means.

No other personal information is collected for any purpose.

If you have any comments or concerns regarding this policy, please contact [hello@shanepelletier.com](mailto:hello@shanepelletier.com).
