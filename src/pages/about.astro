        <h2>Hi! I'm Shane.</h2>
        <p>
            I'm constantly learning new things, and felt like it was time to share some
            of those things with the world. This site is meant to be a space where I
            can learn, explore, and create.
        </p>

            Most of my experience is in backend web services and low-level programming,
            so it will probably be a while before this site looks as nice as most other
            programmer's websites. I hope that the content here is still useful to you.
