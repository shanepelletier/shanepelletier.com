# Hello, world!

This is my third attempt at creating a blog; my first attempt was way back in 2013 when I used a blogging platform written in Ruby called [toto](https://github.com/cloudhead/toto) to write a single post about my dislike of pep rallies, or at least how they were implemented in my high school. My next attempt came in 2016 using a template for [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/). That time I got a little further, writing a whole two posts before abandoning the blog.

On this attempt, I am using [Astro](https://astro.build/) starting from the "Empty" template and building the rest myself. I hope that starting from a blank slate means that I will actually understand how it all goes together, and will make remembering how to add new posts easier. The downside to this approach is that this place will look a little bare for the time being as I learn how to create a nice looking website from scratch.
